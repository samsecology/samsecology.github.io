# Greenlight Ecology Website

> **This project marks the start of my AWS portfolio.**

I designed, developed, and deployed the official website for Greenlight Ecology.  
The site was initially tested and previewed using GitHub Pages, and is now live in production on AWS S3.

- **Production site:** [Live on AWS S3](https://www.greenlightecology.co.uk/)
- **Tech stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS S3 for hosting, GitHub Pages (testing)
- **Role:** End-to-end IT consultantâ€”responsible for all technical aspects: web design, deployment, domain setup, and ongoing support.


## ðŸ”„ Minor Updates: Logo, SSL, and Social Cards

- Swapped site logo to PNG for better Google Search/Knowledge Panel compatibility.
- Updated all references in HTML and favicons.
- Added Organization structured data (JSON-LD) to specify the preferred logo for Google.
- Uploaded changes to S3 and cleared CloudFront cache (including old logo removal).
- Enabled SSL via CloudFront for secure browsing.
- Set up favicon and added Twitter/social card metadata.
- Tested using Google Rich Results, Schema Validator, and browser checks.
- Requested indexing in Google Search Console; logo updates should roll out over time.

_Just some routine improvements to keep everything up to date and easy for Google/social platforms to pick up the right branding._
