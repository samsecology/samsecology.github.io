            <h2>About Ecology</h2>
            <p>
                Ecology is the study of interactions between living organisms and their environment. 
                It encompasses the relationships between plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as their physical surroundings. 
                By understanding these connections, ecologists aim to protect biodiversity, promote sustainable practices, and ensure a harmonious balance between nature and human activities. 
                Join us as we explore the wonders of the natural world and work together to preserve it for future generations.
